## Fashion MNIST CLassification 

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.
Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

The NN model was trained on data downloaded from Kaggle:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist

## Neural Network Architecture
The Neural Network consists of 2 hidden layers with 64 and 32 nodes respectively. The output layer has 10 nodes with softmax activation function.
Loss Function used : Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
